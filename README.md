# Canvas Fingerprinting Detection and Prevention
We analyze samples of Princeton Web Census Data Release(https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus/data-release/details.html) in two notebooks.
To detect fingerprinting we use heuristics described in this paper(https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/OpenWPM_1_million_site_tracking_measurement.pdf#page=12). The code is written using python's Flask framework and is accessible in the API folder.
Chrome extension built based on this is available in the Extension folder.
