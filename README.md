# CanvasFingerprintingPrevention
Canvas fingerprinting detection and prevention
To detect fingerprinting we use Princeton Web Census Data Release(https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus/data-release/details.html), parts of this notebook(https://github.com/citp/openwpm-data-release/blob/master/notebooks/Canvas-Fingerprinting.ipynb) and heuristics described in this paper(https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arvindn/publications/OpenWPM_1_million_site_tracking_measurement.pdf#page=12).
